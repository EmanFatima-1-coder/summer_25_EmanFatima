# Sequence Alignment

This project provides tools and scripts for performing sequence alignment, a fundamental task in bioinformatics for comparing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.

## Features
- Sequence alignment algorithms (global/local)
- Customizable scoring
- Easy-to-use Python script

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python sequence_alignment.py.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts or modify the script to input your sequences and parameters.

## File Structure
- `sequence_alignment.py.py`: Main script for sequence alignment.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
